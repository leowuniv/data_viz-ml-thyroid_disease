Theme:

- Practice Data Fest.
Using your STATS 10 (/Introductory Statistics) skills, analyze a large, messy,
interesting, and most importantly real-world data set. Any data sets you choose will have to be
OKed by me in-person, either during OH or after class. Create at least one high quality statistical
visualizations and at least one confidence interval / hypothesis test / linear model. Make sure that
your coding goes way beyond what you learned in your STATS 10 labs - this is a project for a
programming class and you will have to show a lot of code. In addition to your 2 page report you
will also have to submit a Data Fest style three-slide presentation, including a title slide with your
group name and members, and two slides containing your actual results. Look here for inspiration
http://datafest.stat.ucla.edu/past-datafests/2022-presentation-slides/.
– Good ideas include: any data that is interesting to you and that you have unique insight into. Do
you have hobbies, non-statistics majors or minors with interesting problems.
– Bad ideas include: national politics, major sports leagues, and kaggle; these topics have been
over-analyzed already and you won’t be able to match what’s out there within the framework of
this group project.
