# DataViz Analysis for Stats20 using ML Techniques

UCLA : STATS 20

DataViz Analysis for Stats20 using ML Techniques On Thyroid Disease 💻🩺

----------------

## **Summary**:

The themes that we plan to incorporate for this project includes the "Data Fest" theme with the incorporation of machine learning algorithms (to enhance our understanding of ML techniques) where we will use our prior statistical knowledge and skills to help us analyze a real-world data set. We plan to create a few high quality statistical visualizations (histograms, bargraphs, choropleth map on Tableau, and other plotting functions learned in class) and use hypothesis testing; creating research questions as well. We will follow the rubric and requirements such as writing a 2-page report and 3-slide presentation [referenced from: http://datafest.stat.ucla.edu/past-datafests/2022-presentation-slides/]. 

The topics that we would want to cover are definitely related to machine learning (logistic regression for instance) or AI as to why we are thinking about using datasets from UCI's Machine Learning Repository (see here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/). The data set that we plan to utilize right now is the Thyroid Disease dataset [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/102/thyroid+disease] (still looking for other datasets; this dataset contains 6 databases from the Garavan Institute in Sydney, Australia). [We acknowledge that the dataset may be a little older compared to other datasets within the health topic. Usually, the newer the data the better. However, there currently is still no cure for Thyroid Disease and we will try to find newer datasets relating to our current one to see if there have been any trends or affecting variables.]


## **Theme**:

- Practice Data Fest.

"Using your STATS 10 (/Introductory Statistics) skills, analyze a large, messy, interesting, and most importantly real-world data set. Any data sets you choose will have to be OKed by me in-person, either during OH or after class. Create at least one high quality statistical visualizations and at least one confidence interval / hypothesis test / linear model. Make sure that your coding goes way beyond what you learned in your STATS 10 labs - this is a project for a programming class and you will have to show a lot of code. __**In addition to your 2 page report you will also have to submit a Data Fest style three-slide presentation, including a title slide with your group name and members, and two slides containing your actual results.**__ Look here for inspiration [http://datafest.stat.ucla.edu/past-datafests/2022-presentation-slides/].

    - Good ideas include: any data that is interesting to you and that you have unique insight into. Do
      you have hobbies, non-statistics majors or minors with interesting problems.
      
    – Bad ideas include: national politics, major sports leagues, and kaggle; these topics have been
    over-analyzed already and you won’t be able to match what’s out there within the framework of
    this group project.

    ### Extended Rubric:

    - Analyze a large, messy, interesting, and most importantly real-world data set.
    - Data set should have had a least 1000 observations and between 15-20 variables to
    give you all the flexibility to fully explore relationships among these variables and 
    likely try to determine whether there are potential explanatory variables that may 
    play a role in the changes/relationships to a response variable.
    - (Dataset has been Verified IN PERSON after lecture)
    o Each group member should be trying to produce roughly 3 tests/relationships/analyses
    o Create at least one high quality statistical visualization and at least one confidence interval 
    / hypothesis test / linear model, but you may lean into doing them for each analysis
    o Make sure that your coding goes way beyond what you learned in your STATS 10 labs - this is a project for a
    programming class and you will have to show a lot of code.
    o In addition to your report you will also have to submit a Data Fest style three-slide presentation, including a title
    slide with your group name and members, and two slides containing your actual results. --> [ON BruinLearn FILES SUBMITTED]
